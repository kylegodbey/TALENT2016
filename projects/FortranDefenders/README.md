# Fortran Defenders
## Coding for Hono(u)r

Welcome to our home in the Repo.

Of particular interest right now is the Wood-Saxon Solver in the aptly named WoodSaxon folder. 

Once you compile and run the code, you'll find the **single particle states** in the file named **out**. 

Densities are plotted in the file **densities**, with the order of the columns being *Neutrons, Protons, Total*. 

In **plt**, we plot the central parts of the potential for neutrons and protons (in column 1 and 2 respectively) and then two wavefunctions in the remaining columns. If you want to change which wavefunctions you plot, change it at the bottom of main and recompile.

***Have Fun!***
