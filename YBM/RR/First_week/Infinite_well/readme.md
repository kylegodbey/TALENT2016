#YBM

This routine find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the finite well. <br />
The program return "Eigen_i.txt", with i as the eigenvalues, that can be plotted to visualize wavefunctions.


## Usage

Just few steps: <br />
1. Make, to compile <br />
2. Make do, to run the program <br />
3. Open Gnuplot and use: plot "Eigen_0.txt" w l, "Eigen_1.txt" w l, "Eigen_2.txt" w l, "Eigen_3.txt" w l to obtain plot of the first 4 eigenvalues.
