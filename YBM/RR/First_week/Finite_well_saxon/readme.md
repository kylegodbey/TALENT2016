#YBM

This routine find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Woods-Saxon potential. <br />
The program return "Eigen.txt" that can be plotted to visualize wavefunctions.


## Usage

Just few steps: <br />
1. Make, to compile <br />
2. Make do, to run the program <br />
3. Open Gnuplot and plot "Eigen.txt" <br />
To change the wavefunction modify the value "n" in the header file.
