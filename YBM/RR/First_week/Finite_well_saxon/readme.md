This routine find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Woods-Saxon potential.
The program return "Eigen.txt" that can be plotted to visualize wavefunctions.


## Usage

Just few steps:
1. Make, to compile
2. Make do, to run the program
3. Open Gnuplot and plot "Eigen.txt"
To change the wavefunction modify the value "n" in the header file.
