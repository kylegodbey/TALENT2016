\section{Structure}
This program calculates the eigenvalues and wavefunctions of each given nlj orbital when having a t0-t3 Skyrme potential.

The program consists in a self-consistent method to calculate
for each possible nlj (up to the limit put in the input file) the 
corresponding eigenvalue and wavefunction.

We start from wavefunctions and densities trials (using the WS 3D code).  
When having this, we start the self-consistent loop.
We start calculating the full series of levels for the nucleus we want to study.
As in the previous codes, the eigenvalues are found with the bissection method, which includes the numerov 
method in order to calculate the eigenfunction for each eigenvalue. For each
eigenfunction found, we calculate its nodes, and we modify the extremes of the 
bissection method according to them. When the extremes are closer than epsi,
we exit the loop, and put the eigenvalue as the right extreme of the bissection
method. 
Then we recalculate the eigenfunction with the shooting method, with 
right hand side equal to 0, in order to find the convergence, and we normalize it. 

We do this for neutrons and for protons separately. 

When all possible orbitals are calculated, we rearrange the energy in ascending order, 
in order to find the correct order in the levels. 

After, the density profiles are calculated.

When having all of this, we calculate and compare the Hartree-Fock total energy with the one obtained in the 
previous loop. 
If the difference is less than epsilon, we exit the loop, as we have reached the convergence.

\subsection{Functions and Subroutines}
\begin{itemize}

\item Subroutine WoodsSaxon3D(energy$\_$n,energy$\_$p,quant$\_$n,quant$\_$p,wf$\_$n, wf$\_$p): subroutine to get the 
trial energies and wavefunctions. The energies of the neutrons (protons) will be
stored in the array energy$\_$n  (energy$\_$p), the neutron (proton) quantum numbers
in quant$\_$n (quant$\_$p) and the wavefunctions in wf$\_$n (wf$\_$p). In order to arrange the energy 
levels, we use the subroutine arrage$\_$energy(matrix,wavef).
\item Subroutine arrange$\_$energy(matrix,wavef): function that arranges the eigenvalues in ascending order. 
These values are inside matrix, which includes the energies and quantum numbers. All is 
ordered following the energy ascendancy. Also, the ,matrix that includes all the wavefunctions
(wavef) is also ordered.
 \item Subroutine simpson(N, dx, f, res) : subroutine to integrate the densities, in order to normalize the 
eigenfunctions. Inputs: N number of points in the mesh, dx space between the points in the mesh,f array
to integrate. Output:res  value of the integration. 
\item Function Vcoulomb (N, rho$\_$p): function to calculate the Coulomb potential for protons. As an input
the position in the mesh to calculate (N) and the proton density (rho$\_$p).
\end{itemize}

\section{Makefile}
To run the program, there is a Makefile, that compiles all files that form the code. 
To compile, type \textbf{make}, and an executable \textbf{main} is created. To run the code, 
type \textbf{./main}. And to delete all exectuables and outputs, type either \textbf{make clean} or
\textbf{make clear}. Makefile has to be modified with vi or vim programs.

\section{Extras}
\subsection{Coulomb potential}
Coulomb potential has been added, but the total energy does not give the correct value. \textbf{Is not correct. It has to 
be modified}.
\subsection{BCS.}
With the t0-t3 Skyrme code, we have added, in a different folder, the BCS calculation. 
New subroutines: solve_BCS_equation(L,E_data,N,E_tot, lambda, Delta, v): inputs:  L: the number of shell
E_data(1:L,1:4): 1:energy, 2:n, 3:angular momentum, 4:spin,
N: particle number in BCS system output,
 E_tot: total energy in BCS system,
 lambda: chemical potential, subroutine LU(N, A, b, x, err), subroutine that implements the LU decomposition for the A matrix
 Delta: pairing gap, v(1:L): occupation probability in BCS system..
